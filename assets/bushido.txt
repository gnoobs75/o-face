The 7 Core Virtues of Bushido
These are the most commonly accepted tenets of the samurai code:
Gi (義) – Rectitude/Justice: The ability to make right decisions without hesitation. It involves integrity and doing what is morally correct, regardless of the consequences.
Yu (勇) – Heroic Courage: Facing danger with intelligence and strength. True courage is not blind but is exercised in the cause of righteousness.
Jin (仁) – Benevolence/Compassion: The practice of kindness and mercy toward others, especially the weak or downtrodden.
Rei (礼) – Respect/Politeness: Treating everyone with courtesy and dignity. It stems from feelings of sympathy and modesty.
Makoto (誠) – Honesty/Sincerity: The quality of being truthful in both word and deed. A samurai's word alone was considered a sufficient guarantee of truth.
Meiyo (名誉) – Honor: Maintaining a good reputation and an acute sense of one’s own moral values. For a samurai, life without honor was not worth living.
Chugi (忠義) – Loyalty: Steadfast commitment and duty to one's lord, family, and principles.
